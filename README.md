## Introduction 
`Links` is a VSIX project that contains the [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) Extension which serves as a quick access to websites of interest.

## Installation
You can get the extension either by downloading and installing it manually from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Enterwell.enterwellvslinksvsix)

## Usage
Extension is always visible in the standard toolbar at the end in the form of Menu Controller.

By default, there are 3 standard working-out-of-the-box buttons that take the user to their respective websites:

+ Organization's Wiki
+ Organization's default Azure DevOps page
+ Clockify used by an organization to track hours on different projects

**Additional Buttons** button servers only as a placeholder for further configuration. It does nothing by itself. It is separated from the default buttons with a divider.

It is possible to extend and configure the URLs in the Options page. Go to:

+ **Tools -> Options..**
+ In the Options page find the **Extensions** category
+ Inside of the category, **Links** page is placed

  Here, developer can change the target URLs for the three default buttons and also assign **Additional Buttons** if needed.

+ If the developer wants to add new buttons, by opening the **Additional Buttons** collection, he can *add*, *remove*, *delete* or *rearrange* the additional buttons.

By saving the options, extension's Menu Controller is automatically updated to reflect new settings. Notice that the placeholder button is now removed.
